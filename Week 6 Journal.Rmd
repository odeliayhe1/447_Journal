# _Week 6_

Week 6 workbook was about writing an introduction with the data that was stripped down from my thesis. Whilst it went ok, I kinda miss figuring out the codes and that sense of achievement after I get it done [^1]. But it's a relief at the same time that I can finally work on stuff that I actually know how.

## _Hurdles_

There wasn't exactly hurdles per se for this workbook but I did experience some difficulties trying to get my code to work, especially when I have to use my own data now. The NaNs made me wondered a little why they existed but I kinda figured out and am still wondering if I should remove them for this lab report. I will pretty much be using this introduction if itâ€™s alright but I plan to include age into this report as a moderating factor. I also plan to include the sample size used in the individual studies to illustrate the statistical power of the respective correlation coefficients. I have not decided on how I am going to go about doing these yet and thus, have not included it in this workbook.

### _End of workbook_

I am not sure if I'm being unrealistically hopeful by trying to include all these ideas into this report and it would probably make my life alot easier if I don't - considering that I only have 2.5k words for this report. But I guess things will work out as I go, and I still have some learning on Metafor to do.

[^1]: I'm regretting it already as I type this.
